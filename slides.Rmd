Ireland can be considered as a housing bubble as it has one of the highest ratio of Housing prices adjusted for inflation in the world.

Almost 40% of Irish population leave in greater Dublin (1.9M/4.9M inhabitant) spread on a 318 km2 urban area resulting in one of the lowest population density in an European capital (4,811 inhabitant/km2).

# Market History

Housing prices are included in an economic context. Despite, having one of European highest economic growth (5.5% in 2019), Ireland suffered badly form the economic crash between 2008 and 2012.

# A Data Science Insight

All properties purchased has to be published online on the [Property Price Register](https://propertypriceregister.ie):

- Since January 2010
- Filed by the owners
- Contains only the address and the price

In its current form, the property price register is only used by buyers to compare the price of their future acquisition with the price that houses has be sold in the same street.  
 
However it could also be used to have an overall view of the price distribution by geocoding the addresses using sing [Nominatim REST API from Open Street Map](http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org):

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
address <- "10 Downing St, Westminster, London SW1A 2AA, United Kingdom"
api_url <- "http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search/@addr@?format=json&addressdetails=0&limit=1"

api_url |> 
  stringr::str_replace("\\@addr\\@", stringr::str_replace(address, "\\s+", "\\%20")) |> 
  jsonlite::fromJSON() |>
  dplyr::select(lat, lon)
#           lat                  lon
# 1 51.50344025 -0.12770820958562096
```

---

# Spatial Density with GAM

Once the lat/lon has been obtained, it is possible to estimate the typical property price in a 2D space:
- Use of Generalized Additive Model (GAM, see [Wood, 2017](Generalized additive models: An introduction with R))
- Application of a soap film smoother to solve the "finite area smoothing" problem due to the coastal shape of Dublin's area

# 2. Urban and Socio-Economic Correlates

---

# Method

In order to predict the property prices with Urban and Socio-Economic features, a machine learning algorithm is used: XGBoost (https://xgboost.readthedocs.io).

> XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In order to make the final prediction, the training continues iteratively, inserting new trees that predict the residuals or errors of previous trees that are then combined with previous trees. It's called gradient boosting since, when introducing new models, it uses a gradient descent algorithm to minimise the loss. 

> XGBoost is a great choice for a wide variety of real-world machine learning problems and is the most used for Kaggle Data Science Challenges (see [`r emo::ji("link")`](https://towardsdatascience.com/xgboost-lightgbm-and-other-kaggle-competition-favorites-6212e8b0e835))

The price of each property is related with:
- Its closest distance to each of 161 urban elements (e.g., bar, university, park, stadium, ...)
- Each of the 48 socio-economic characteristics of the geographic small where the property is situated

## Analysis 1: Urban Correlates

# Urban Correlates

Are property prices correlating with their distance to urban landmarks?

Calculation of shortest distance to each property GPS location with one of 160 urban features from the [Overpass API of Open Street Map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API).

For example, here is the query for all the pubs in Dublin:

.pull-left[

```{r exosmdata, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(osmdata)

  opq("Dublin") |>
  add_osm_feature(
    key = "amenity",
    value = "pub"
  ) |>
  osmdata_sp() |>
  use_series("osm_points") |>
  plot()
```

]
.pull-right[

```{r ref.label="exosmdata", echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(4, 4)}

```
.center.tiny[Location of results obtained from the query `amenity = pub` in Dublin using the R package {osmdata}.]

# Urban Correlates

Use these distances as predictors of the property price in a XGBoost model (tree based boosted regression, see [Chen & Guestrin, 2016](Generalized additive models: An introduction with R)). The dataset was randomly split in a train and in a test dataset (80% vs. 20%).

The results reveal that the **model explains 44% of the variance of the property prices** of the test dataset ...

The **density of individual not providing regular unpaid personal help** in the area is the most important socio-economic feature to predict property prices. 

**Large properties** in the area and the proportion of **individuals reporting having no religion** are also relatively important.

# 3. Conclusion

---

# Conclusion

By preforming a feature analysis with urban and socio-economic features, it is possible to evaluate and predict the potential price of a property. 

--

- The presence of embassies or parks are criteria that influence significantly the price of properties.

--

- Similarly, the characteristics of inhabitants in the area such as religion, health and age is correlated to the evolution of housing prices. 

--

These results allow an understanding of why some areas have higher prices than others which is relevant information not only for real estate agents in charge of property valuations but also for buyers in order to estimate the real value of a property.

# Limitations and Perspectives

Still an ongoing work, more to follow in the coming weeks...

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` Essential features haven't been taken into account:
- House characteristics (e.g., square meter size, number bedrooms, ...)
- Macroeconomic trends (e.g., economic growth, unemployment, ...)

`r faa("exclamation-triangle", animate="flash", speed="slow", color="red")` Essential features are difficult to assess:
- Market size
- Market demand 

A more global view is required to confirm the results:
- Full country perspective
- Comparison between cities

A temporal perspective would also be interesting to study
